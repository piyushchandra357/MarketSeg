# Market Segmentation Projects

### 1. Study Share

### 2. EVs in India

## Study Share

Students in higher education frequently encounter significant disparities in the accessibility of
the study materials, be it a guidebook, or the main study material. The problem lies in the fact
that the universities make their own curriculum and hence they do not include the whole books,
except just some pages or chapters from it. So, the students are left relying on their professors
for  the  study  material.  Since  all  tier-2  and  tier-3  universities  are  not  capable  of  providing
maintained  course  material  the  students  are  not  provided  with  equal  access  to  the  course
material or due to the difference in teaching methodologies among different professors. These
variations  can  result  in  uneven  distribution  of  skill  and  knowledge  on  a  university  scale.
Nationally, it could prove to be a youth skill issue. StudyShare alleviates these disparities by
providing a platform for students to access all the study material from their peers in different
classes, colleges and universities.

## Electric Vehicles in India

This project focuses on analyzing the electric vehicle (EV) market in India. By leveraging various datasets, the goal is to develop a comprehensive market segmentation strategy that can help understand consumer behavior, market dynamics, and identify strategic entry points for EVs.

### Datasets

The project utilizes the following datasets:

1. **`df_ev_details`**: Contains information about electric vehicles available in India as of 2023.
   - **Columns**: `Car_name`, `Car_price`, `Battery_cap` (capacity in kWh), `Drive_range` (range in km), `Power` (in hp or kW), `Charge_time_hours` (charging time in hours)

2. **`df_survey`**: Provides data on consumer knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding EV adoption.
   - **Columns**: `gender`, `age`, `occupation`, `K1` to `K5` (knowledge questions), `ATT1` to `ATT5` (attitude questions), `P1` to `P5` (practice questions)

3. **`df_consumer_behaviour`**: Contains data on consumer buying behavior in the Indian automobile sector.
   - **Columns**: `Age`, `Profession`, `Marital Status`, `Education`, `No of Dependents`, `Personal loan`, `House Loan`, `Wife Working`, `Salary`, `Wife Salary`, `Total Salary`, `Make`, `Car_price`

4. **`df_ev_category`**: Shows the number of different types of vehicles in various Indian states.
   - **Columns**: `State Name`, `Two Wheeler`, `Three Wheeler`, `Four Wheeler`, `Goods Vehicles`, `Public Service Vehicle`, `Special Category Vehicles`, `Ambulance/Hearses`, `Construction Equipment Vehicle`, `Other`, `Grand Total`
